            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>
                I am a Computer Science: Game Design student interested in building interactive
                systems and procedural tools for games and creative media. My background combines
                programming with game design, which shapes how I approach both technical and visual work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Much of my recent work focuses on procedural generation. I am interested in how
                generative systems can create variation, support exploration, and help communicate
                ideas that are difficult to express through static content alone.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am particularly drawn to projects that use games and interactive media for
                education and for raising awareness around environmental issues. In these contexts,
                systems-based design can help players understand scale, constraints, and long-term
                effects through interaction rather than explanation.
            </p>

            <p>
                This portfolio includes research on procedural content generation with large language
                models, as well as creative coding projects that explore atmosphere, motion, and
                environmental variation.
