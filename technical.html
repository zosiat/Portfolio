        <h2>Procedural Content Generation with LLMs</h2>

        <p>
            This project comes from an undergraduate research course with Professor Jim Whitehead,
            where I worked with a group of students on procedural content generation for games.
            Throughout the class, we explored noise-based generation,
            tile-based maps, and wave function collapse.
        </p>

        <p>
            My primary contribution was working on developing the TinyTown generator, with a focus on structured
            the placement of decorative objects within the procedurally generated tilemap.
            I also worked on evaluating large language model outputs by analyzing and correcting
            responses related to tile identification and spatial reasoning.
        </p>

        <p>
            As part of the research, we created the TinyTownQA dataset to study how well different
            language models understand and reason about tile-based game worlds. This work helped
            inform experiments comparing text-based, image-based, and hybrid world representations.
        </p>

        <p>
            The results of this project were published at FDG 2025. Through this research group,
            I gained practical experience with procedural systems, collaborative research,
            and building tools to support experimental evaluation.
